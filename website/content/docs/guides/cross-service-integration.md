The hardest bugs in AWS applications live in the wiring between services. A Lambda that's supposed to trigger on S3 uploads but doesn't. An EventBridge rule that fires but delivers to the wrong target. A Step Functions state machine that waits forever because the Lambda integration is shaped wrong.

Mocks can't catch those bugs. They test each service in isolation, and the wiring between them is exactly where the bugs hide.

fakecloud actually executes the cross-service wiring. When an EventBridge rule matches, it really delivers to the target. When an SES receipt rule evaluates, it really invokes the Lambda. When an S3 object is uploaded, it really publishes the notification. Tests that exercise end-to-end behavior work the same way they would against real AWS.

## Supported integrations

**Messaging and eventing:**

- **SNS -> SQS / Lambda / HTTP** — Fan-out delivery to all subscription types.
- **S3 -> SNS / SQS / Lambda / EventBridge** — Bucket notifications on object create/delete.
- **EventBridge -> SNS / SQS / Lambda / Logs / Kinesis / Step Functions / HTTP** — Rules deliver to targets on schedule or event match, including API Destinations.
- **SQS -> Lambda** — Event source mapping polls queues. Honors `FilterCriteria` (drop non-matching), `MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds` (hold partial batches), and `FunctionResponseTypes=[ReportBatchItemFailures]` (Lambda response `{"batchItemFailures":[{"itemIdentifier":...}]}` retries only the failed messages).
- **Kinesis -> Lambda** — Event source mapping polls shards. Honors `FilterCriteria` (advances past dropped records) and `StartingPosition` (`TRIM_HORIZON` / `LATEST` / `AT_TIMESTAMP`) on first poll.
- **DynamoDB Streams -> Lambda** — Event source mapping polls stream records. Honors `FilterCriteria` (advances past dropped records) and `StartingPosition` (`TRIM_HORIZON` / `LATEST`).
- **DynamoDB -> Kinesis** — Table changes stream to Kinesis Data Streams.
- **CloudWatch Logs -> Lambda / Kinesis / SQS** — Subscription filters deliver log events.
- **Lambda async destinations -> SQS / SNS / EventBridge / Lambda** — `InvocationType=Event` invocations route their result through `OnSuccess` / `OnFailure` using AWS's standard destinations record schema.

**Identity and auth:**

- **Cognito -> Lambda** — All 12 triggers: PreSignUp, PostConfirmation, PreAuthentication, PostAuthentication, CustomMessage, PreTokenGeneration, UserMigration, DefineAuthChallenge, CreateAuthChallenge, VerifyAuthChallengeResponse, CustomEmailSender, CustomSMSSender.
- **Cognito -> SES** — Verification emails for SignUp / ResendConfirmationCode / ForgotPassword / GetUserAttributeVerificationCode dispatch through SES (CustomEmailSender Lambda takes precedence when configured).
- **Cognito -> SNS** — SMS verification codes dispatch through SNS as `sms_messages` (CustomSMSSender Lambda takes precedence when configured).

**Email:**

- **SES -> SNS / EventBridge** — Email event fanout (send, delivery, bounce, complaint) via configured event destinations.
- **SES Inbound -> S3 / SNS / Lambda** — Receipt rules evaluate inbound email and execute S3, SNS, and Lambda actions for real.

**Orchestration and APIs:**

- **Step Functions -> Lambda / SQS / SNS / EventBridge / DynamoDB** — Task states invoke Lambda, send SQS messages, publish to SNS topics, put EventBridge events, and read/write DynamoDB items.
- **API Gateway v2 -> Lambda** — HTTP API routes invoke Lambda functions with proxy integration v2.0 format.

**Infrastructure:**

- **CloudFormation -> Lambda / SNS** — Custom resources invoke via `ServiceToken`, stack events notify via `NotificationARNs`.
- **Secrets Manager -> Lambda** — Rotation invokes Lambda for all 4 steps.
- **Secrets Manager -> KMS** — When a secret has `KmsKeyId`, `CreateSecret` / `PutSecretValue` call `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `GetSecretValue` calls `kms:Decrypt` with the AWS-shaped encryption context `{aws:secretsmanager:secretArn: <arn>}`. Auto-provisions the `aws/secretsmanager` AWS-managed key on first use. All KMS calls are recorded at `/_fakecloud/kms/usage`.
- **SSM SecureString -> KMS** — `PutParameter` with `Type=SecureString` calls `kms:GenerateDataKey`; `GetParameter*` with `WithDecryption=true` calls `kms:Decrypt`. The encryption context is `{PARAMETER_ARN: <arn>}` and the default `aws/ssm` key auto-provisions on first use; pass `KeyId` for a customer-managed key.
- **S3 SSE-KMS -> KMS** — `PutObject` with `ServerSideEncryption=aws:kms` calls `kms:GenerateDataKey`; `GetObject` decrypts via `kms:Decrypt`. The encryption context is `{aws:s3:arn: arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>}` and ranged reads are sliced from plaintext, not the stored ciphertext envelope. The default `aws/s3` key auto-provisions on first use.
- **SQS encrypted queue -> KMS** — `SendMessage` on a queue with `KmsMasterKeyId` calls `kms:GenerateDataKey`; `ReceiveMessage` calls `kms:Decrypt` and returns the plaintext body. Encryption context: `{aws:sqs:arn: <queue-arn>}`. The on-queue body is the ciphertext envelope; only the returned copy is decrypted.
- **SNS encrypted topic -> KMS** — `Publish` to a topic with `KmsMasterKeyId` records the matching `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` audit-trail records (SNS encrypts at rest then decrypts to fan-out). Encryption context: `{aws:sns:arn: <topic-arn>}`.
- **DynamoDB encrypted table -> KMS** — `PutItem` / `UpdateItem` on a table with `SSESpecification.SSEType=KMS` records `kms:GenerateDataKey`; `GetItem` / `Query` / `Scan` records `kms:Decrypt`. Item bodies are not actually encrypted — fakecloud emits the audit-trail records the AWS API would produce so callers can assert KMS usage on encrypted tables.
- **S3 Lifecycle** — Background expiration and storage class transitions.
- **EventBridge Scheduler** — Cron and rate-based rules fire on schedule.
- **RDS -> EventBridge** — DB instance and snapshot lifecycle ops (create, modify, delete, reboot, start, stop, snapshot create/delete, restore) emit `aws.rds` events that match the AWS event schema.
- **ECS -> EventBridge** — Task state transitions emit `ECS Task State Change` events on the default bus. Event `detail` carries the task ARN, cluster ARN, last status, stop code/reason on STOPPED, and a per-container summary including exit code.
- **ECS -> ECR** — Task definitions that reference AWS-private-ECR URIs (`<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repo>:<tag>`) resolve against fakecloud's local OCI v2 endpoint at runtime. The runtime pulls from `127.0.0.1:<port>/<repo>:<tag>`, retags to the AWS URI, and runs the container under the user-visible image name. Same resolution applies to Lambda functions deployed with `PackageType=Image` and a fakecloud ECR `Code.ImageUri`.
- **ECS awslogs -> CloudWatch Logs** — Containers declaring `logDriver=awslogs` get every captured stdout/stderr line forwarded to fakecloud Logs. The runtime honors `awslogs-create-group=true`, creates a stream named `<prefix>/<container-name>/<task-id>`, and downstream subscription filters fire on the appended events.
- **ECS task secrets -> Secrets Manager / SSM** — Container `secrets[]` entries with a SecretsManager or SSM Parameter Store ARN are resolved synchronously at task launch and injected as environment variables before `docker run`. Missing values fail the task with `stopCode=TaskFailedToStart`, mirroring real ECS.
- **ECS task role -> IAM credentials** — Tasks registered with a `taskRoleArn` get `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` injected into every container, pointing at a fakecloud-local IMDS-format credential endpoint. AWS SDKs pick this up via the default credential-provider chain so `aws sts get-caller-identity` (and any other SDK call) works from inside the container.
- **ECR signing -> KMS** — When a repository has `cosign` keyed-mode (ECDSA-P256) verification configured, `PutImage` requires a matching signature manifest in the registry. Unsigned or wrong-key images are rejected.
- **IAM PassRole trust enforcement** — Lambda `CreateFunction` and ECS `RegisterTaskDefinition` / `RunTask` overrides reject role ARNs whose `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` doesn't list the calling service principal (`lambda.amazonaws.com`, `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com`), the same way real AWS does.

## Testing a cross-service flow

The pattern is the same for all of them: configure the wiring via the normal AWS SDK, trigger the upstream event, then assert on the downstream state via the fakecloud SDK.

Example — S3 upload triggers Lambda via an event source:

```typescript
import { FakeCloud } from "fakecloud";
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const fc = new FakeCloud();

// (assume bucket, Lambda, and notification config already created via SDK)

await new S3Client({ endpoint: "http://localhost:4566", /* ... */ }).send(
  new PutObjectCommand({ Bucket: "my-bucket", Key: "uploads/hello.txt", Body: "hi" })
);

// Lambda really ran. Assert on its invocations.
const { invocations } = await fc.lambda.getInvocations();
expect(invocations).toHaveLength(1);
expect(invocations[0].event.Records[0].s3.object.key).toBe("uploads/hello.txt");
```

No mocks. The S3 upload actually triggered the notification, which actually invoked the Lambda, which actually ran and recorded its invocation — all in the same fakecloud process. If any step of that wiring is broken in your code, the test fails the same way it would against real AWS.

## What doesn't exist yet
